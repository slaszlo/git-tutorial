# Git Tutorial

This repository contains some best practices about the git.

This tutorial doesn't want to become an thesis or a beginner guide. It's a simple tutorial to a specific way of working with git. I don't say it's the best way of handling the git. But it's working :)

## Basics

### What is the git?

It's a distributed version control system. Further reading in the [Wikipedia][1].

If you want to learn more before you go further, I reocmend you the [Git Handbook][2].
